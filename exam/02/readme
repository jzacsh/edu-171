A bowling team contains 5 players, and a bowling match is 3 games. A game
score is 0 to 300 points. Write a program to calculate and display each
player's bowling average for one match, and the team average for the match.
The program must also contain three methods (one methods is "main" which his
the test program, one method calculates a player's average, and one method
calculates the team average). A two dismensional array is an argument to the
team average method, and a one dimensional array is an argument to the
player's average method. The average is the sum of the game scores divided by
the number of games.
