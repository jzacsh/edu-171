Calculating interest
If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can
compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:

  interest = balance * (annualInterestRate / 1200)

write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate
and displays the interest for the next month in two versions: (a) Use dialog
boxes to obtain input and display output; (b) Use console input and output. A
sample run of the console input and output shown in Figure 2.14

  Enter balance: 100000
  Enter annual interest rate: 4.625
  The interest is 385.41
