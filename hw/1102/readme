Computing the future investment value
Write a method that computes future investment value at a given interest rate
for a specified number of years. the future investment is determined using the
formula in Exercise 2.9, as seen here:
  futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ (numberOfYears * 12)

Use the following method header:
  public static double futureInvestmentValue(
    double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate, int years)

For example, futureInvestmentValue(10000, 0.05/12, 5) returns 12833.59

write a test program that prompts the user to enter the investment amount
(eg.: 1000) and the interest rate (eg.: 9%), and print a table that displays
future value for the years from 1 to 30, as shown below:

  The amount invested: 1000
  Annual interest rate: 9%
  Years   Future Value
   1       1093.8
   2       1196.41
   ...     
   29      13467.25
   30      14730.57
