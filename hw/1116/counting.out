Below I will generate a 'random' number between 0 and 9, 100 times.
Then I will calculate the occurances of each number.

-- occurances of each random number -------------------------------
0                                                      2 occurances
1                                                      8 occurances
2                                                     12 occurances
3                                                      9 occurances
4                                                     15 occurances
5                                                      9 occurances
6                                                     12 occurances
7                                                     13 occurances
8                                                      8 occurances
9                                                     12 occurances

You can verify the output of this program by running the following:
java counting | awk '/occurances$/{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }'
