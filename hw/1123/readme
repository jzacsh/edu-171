(increasing array size)
Once an array is created, its size is fixed. Occasionally, you need to add
more values to an array, but it is full. In such a case, you can create a new,
larger array to replace the existing array. Write a method with the following
header:
  public static int[] doubleCapacity(int[] list)
the method returns a new array that doubles the size of the parameter `list'.
